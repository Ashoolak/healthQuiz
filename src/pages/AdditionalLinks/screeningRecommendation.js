          If you are sexually active, getting tested for STDs is one of the most
          important things you can do to protect your health. Make sure you have
          an open and honest conversation about your sexual history and STD
          testing with your doctor and ask whether you should be tested for
          STDs. If you are not comfortable talking with your regular health care
          provider about STDs, there are many clinics that provide confidential
          and free or low-cost testing.

          <li className="text-lg">
            All sexually active women younger than 25 years should be tested for
            gonorrhea and chlamydia every year. Women 25 years and older with
            risk factors such as new or multiple sex partners or a sex partner
            who has an STD should also be tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia
            every year.
          </li>
          <li className="text-lg">
            Everyone who is pregnant should be tested for syphilis, HIV,
            hepatitis B, and hepatitis C starting early in pregnancy. Those at
            risk for infection should also be tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea
            starting early in pregnancy. Repeat testing may be needed in some
            cases.
          </li>
          <li className="text-lg">
            All sexually active gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with

              </li>
              <li>At least once a year for hepatitis C, if living with HIV.</li>

          <li className="text-lg">
            Anyone who engages in sexual behaviors that could place them at risk
            for infection or shares injection drug equipment should get tested
            for HIV at least once a year.
          </li>
          <li className="text-lg">
